# Repository content
This repository contains the code for the **Gamified Image Annotation Platform**.

It consists of two folders:
* *code* contains the actual code of several tools (API, frontend, questionnaire_analyzer, TagJudge).
* *images* contains the images used in the study. A separate licence is used for those.
